# CVProject_celldetection
 I achieved to detect hemopoietic cell by using multi-radius ring filter. The hough transformation is very sensitive to the selected radius and needs a good edge detection so it did bad job for detection of hemopoietic cell. I track cells by detecting frame-by-frame and regard circle at most closest position as the same cell.
